Description: The groupr package provides a more powerful version of grouped
  tibbles from dplyr. It allows groups in a tibble to be marked inapplicable,
  which is a simple but widely useful way to express structure in a dataset.
  It also provides powerful pivoting and other group manipulation functions.
